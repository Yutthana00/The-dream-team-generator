# The-dream-team-generator

### Changes made:
    - video link to delopment video is now public.
    - HTML file is created afterdata has been inputed.

The Aim is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so youâ€™ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.
